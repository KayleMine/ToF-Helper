**Auto-Rotation Note:** When using this note that if you go into ToF-Helper.ahk and look for the F14 Keybinding like below, 
you can change the F14 to an alternative key. This key turns on Use 1 which will auto use your 1 ability in your rotation as well.
I will be switching this soon and using image scanning to detect what weapons you have on and it will just auto use 1 on the weapons
that it's ok to use on. That awill take a bit due to the transparencies in the weapon looks, makes for a tough time screen scanning.

**Infinite Climb Note:** Thank you to ToFU-AHK-Flex for this as my own Infinite Climb was sub-par, his had perfect timings and never failed.
